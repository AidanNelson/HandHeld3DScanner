With this, you may export the STL, or even edit the model yourself if you want to fork the design!

Provided in this directory are some pre-generated STL, STEP, and IGES files of the design.

Remember, for full edit capabilities, please visit the link above.

The pre-generated files have a watermark. Hate it? Go edit it! I'm not stopping you...

Hardware Required
=================

 * Top Lid Screws and Nuts (qty=4 each)
   * M3 thread, 12mm long, button head
   * M3 square nuts (5.5mm wide)
 * Rasp-Pi Screws (qty=4)
   * M2.5 thread, 12mm long, button head
 * Intel RealSense D415 Mount Screw (qty=1)
   * 1/4"-20 thread, 1/2" long, button head
 * Tripod Mount (optional)
   * McMaster-Carr part number "90594A024"
   * secured with a M3 thread 10mm long countersunk screw
   * and a M3 ny-lock nut
 * Lanyard and Wrist-Strap
   * get creative
   * the slot on the bottom is meant for you to secure the power cable with a velcro strap

Electronics Required
====================

 * Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 4GB of RAM
   * with the largest and fastest microSD card you can afford
   * a good USB flash drive might help
 * HyperPixel 4
   * current design is meant for the rectangular version of the HyperPixel
   * a fork of the 3D model for the square HyperPixel will be made once I can buy one
 * Barrel Jack
   * The 3D model has a hole meant for a Tensility 54-00064 or Switchcraft 712AFMS (or similar)
   * Find or make the matching cable yourself
   * modify the 3D model if you want to use something else
 * Cooling Fan
   * 25mm x 25mm x 10mm
   * must be 5V DC
   * get some heat-sinks designed for the Pi 4
 * Connector between the Barrel Jack and the Pi
   * Any in-line Molex connector will work
   * I would avoid JST-PH for the main power, it's too small
 * Power Supply
   * a good power-bank should work
 * USB Cable
   * Must be a USB-C to USB-A 3.1 cable, 3 inches (as short as possible)
 * Misc
   * heat shrink tubing
   * wires, suggested use 22 AWG stranded, silicone insulated
   * soldering supplies
