rs-pointcloud-recorder
======================

This is just the same rs-pointcloud example from librealsense2, but with a few extra lines that records to a bag file. So if you provide a file-path argument when launching `rs-pointcloud-recorder`, it will record to that file.

This project is not included as a part of the automatic installation. This is just for me to practice. The patch file for librealsense in the installation scripts actually patches the same changes into the librealsense build itself.
